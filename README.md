# QrLipsync

Lip sync should be within +45 to -125 milliseconds for most people not to notice. Our brains are at least two times more sensitive to early audio than to late audio because audio doesnâ€™t come before video in the natural world. Achieving good-enough lipsync (i.e. within this range) is necessary to ensure a good quality of experience for the viewers.

QrLipsync is an audio-video latency (also referred to as [lipsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync)) measurement and validation tool.

It works by

* crafting a special video whose video and audio tracks contain encoded metadata (into a qrcode for the video, and as an easily detectable frequency), a sample is available for download [here](https://u.nu/qrubi)
* capturing this special video with a video playback or capture system
* extracting the encoded metadata by analyzing the recorded file audio and video
* computing statistics about the extracted data (actual framerate, frame drops/duplications, audio/video delay)

For instance, in order to validate a playback device (e.g. an embedded mediacenter), just playback the special media file generated with QrLipsync and capture the hdmi output using a validated capture device; analyzing the captured file will effectively measure how well the playback device did handle the a/v latency. Note that being qrcode-based, this method will work very well in degraded conditions, like filming a screen in a non-ortoghonal situation.

## Installation

Install the required packages; the following has been tested on ubuntu 18.04:
```
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-{base,good,bad,ugly} gstreamer1.0-libav python3-gst-1.0 gstreamer1.0-tools python3-setuptools ffmpeg
```

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

Alternatively, you can run without installing with:
```
PATH=$PATH:bin PYTHONPATH=. qr-lipsync-generate.py
PATH=$PATH:bin PYTHONPATH=. qr-lipsync-detect.py cam1-qrcode-blue-30.qt
```

Or even
```
sudo ln -s `pwd`/bin/*.py /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s `pwd`/qrlipsync `python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])"`
```

## Running tests

```
python setup.py test
```

## Usage

### qr-lipsync-generate.py

Will build a cam1-qrcode.qt reference video

```$ ./qr-lipsync-generate.py```

![Screenshot of reference video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UbiCastTeam/qr-lipsync/master/sample.png)

### qr-lipsync-detect.py

Will extract metadata and write it into the cam1-qrcode_data.txt file. Will run analysis too.

```$ ./qr-lipsync-detect.py cam1-qrcode.qt```

### qr-lipsync-analyze.py

Analyze results without re-detecting.

```$ ./qr-lipsync-analyze.py cam1-qrcode_data.txt```

Sample output:
